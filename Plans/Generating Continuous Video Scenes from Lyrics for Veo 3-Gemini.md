### Full Guide: Generating Continuous Video Scenes from Lyrics for Veo 3

This guide provides a comprehensive method for transforming song lyrics into a series of continuous, cinematic video prompts using a Large Language Model (LLM). The output is structured to be directly fed into a text-to-video model like Google's Veo 3.

#### The Strategy: Director's Treatment AI

The core concept is to instruct an LLM to act as a "Music Video Director." This AI director performs two main tasks:
1.  **Creates a "Style Guide"**: It first establishes a high-level vision for the entire video, defining a consistent character, setting, mood, and cinematic style. This ensures a coherent visual language from start to finish.
2.  **Writes a "Shot List"**: It then breaks the lyrics into logical scenes and writes a detailed, continuous prompt for each one. Crucially, prompts for later scenes build upon the previous ones, describing changes and evolutions rather than re-stating the entire scene, which is key for creating continuity.

The entire process is designed to be completed in a single API call to the LLM, which returns a structured JSON object that your Python application can easily parse and use.

### Step 1: The Master LLM Prompt

This is the complete prompt to send to your LLM (e.g., Gemini). It instructs the model on its role, the precise steps to follow, the rules for continuity, and the required JSON output format. Copy this entire text block and integrate it into your Python script. You will programmatically insert your song's lyrics into the designated spot.

You are an expert music video director and cinematic prompt writer for Google's Veo 3 text-to-video model. Your task is to transform the provided song lyrics into a complete, scene-by-scene shot list that forms a continuous and coherent music video.

Follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Create a "Style Guide"**: First, define the core visual elements for the entire video. This guide will ensure consistency. It must include:
    *   `character`: A detailed description of the main character (e.g., "A young woman in her early 20s with long, windswept auburn hair, wearing a vintage, flowing white dress").
    *   `setting`: The primary location or environment (e.g., "A vast, misty, and ancient forest at twilight, with towering redwood trees and glowing flora").
    *   `mood`: The overall emotional tone (e.g., "Melancholic, dreamlike, and introspective").
    *   `cinematic_style`: The camera work and visual effects (e.g., "Hyper-realistic, shot on anamorphic lenses, slow-motion, with subtle lens flares and a desaturated, cinematic color grade").

2.  **Segment Lyrics into Scenes**: Read through the entire lyrics and break them down into logical scenes. A scene break should occur at a natural shift in the song's narrative, emotion, or theme.

3.  **Write Continuous Veo Prompts**: For each scene, write a specific and detailed prompt for Veo 3. Adhere to these rules for continuity:
    *   **The First Prompt**: The prompt for Scene 1 should be very descriptive, fully establishing the character and setting based on your Style Guide.
    *   **Subsequent Prompts**: For Scene 2 and onwards, **DO NOT** repeat the full description. Instead, describe the **evolution** from the previous scene. Focus on the character's new action, a change in their expression, a shift in lighting, or a specific camera movement. Use transitional phrases to ensure a seamless flow (e.g., "The camera slowly pans left to reveal...", "Her expression now shifts to a faint smile as...", "Suddenly, the forest floor begins to glow brighter...").

4.  **Output Format**: Your entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON object. The JSON should have two top-level keys: `style_guide` (containing the object from step 1) and `scenes` (a list of scene objects). Each object in the `scenes` list must contain:
    *   `scene_number` (integer)
    *   `lyrics` (string of the lyrics for that scene)
    *   `veo_prompt` (the detailed, continuous prompt for Veo 3)


Here are the lyrics:
"""
<INSERT YOUR FULL SONG LYRICS HERE>
"""

Now, generate the complete JSON output.
```

### Step 2: Full Python Implementation

This Python script demonstrates the complete workflow. It includes:
1.  The song lyrics.
2.  A function to build the master prompt from Step 1.
3.  A function to call the LLM and parse the structured JSON response.
4.  A main execution block that prints the generated style guide and the list of Veo prompts, ready for submission to the video generation API.

```python
import google.generativeai as genai
import json
import os

def generate_video_storyboard_from_lyrics(lyrics: str, llm_model: genai.GenerativeModel) -> dict | None:
    """
    Builds the master prompt, sends it to the LLM, and parses the JSON response.

    Args:
        lyrics: A string containing the full song lyrics.
        llm_model: An initialized Gemini GenerativeModel instance.

    Returns:
        A dictionary containing the video storyboard, or None if an error occurs.
    """
    
    # This is the exact prompt from Step 1, formatted as an f-string
    master_prompt = f"""

The city clock tower chimes a lonely sound
Midnight oil is burning, another cup I've drowned
Streetlights paint gold rivers on the wet asphalt ground
I'm just a silhouette in this sleeping town

And I'm searching for a spark in the pouring rain
A flicker of a memory to ease the pain
Trying to find my way back home again
Just a whisper of your name in the hurricane

Remember dancing barefoot in the summer grass so green
Felt like we were living in a movie scene
Now the color's faded, it's a future unforeseen
Staring at a ghost on a silver screen
