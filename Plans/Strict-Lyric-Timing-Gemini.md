Excellent analysis. You've correctly diagnosed the problem. Hitting a response size or token limit is a classic issue when dealing with large, detailed data generation tasks. The word-level timing creates a very verbose JSON, and requesting it all at once for a full song is unreliable.

The best practice to solve this is to change the methodology from a single large request to multiple smaller, targeted requests. We will process the song one section at a time. This ensures that each response is well under any size limits, and you can reliably stitch the complete data together on your end.

Here is the revised, more robust prompt and workflow.

***

### **Revised Prompt for Section-Based Lyric Synchronization**

This is the prompt you will send for **each section** of the song (e.g., Verse 1, then Chorus 1, then Verse 2, etc.).

**Your Role:** You are an AI assistant specializing in audio and lyric synchronization.

**Your Task:** You will receive an audio file and the plain text lyrics for a **single section** of a song (e.g., one verse or one chorus). Your task is to analyze the audio to determine the precise timing of each word for only the lines provided. You MUST process all lyric lines sent in this request. The output must be a structured JSON object containing only the data for the provided lines.

**Objective:** The output must be a machine-readable JSON object that provides word-level synchronization for the given song section. This data will be combined with other sections later to create a complete, synchronized lyric file.

### **Required Output Format**

The output MUST be a single JSON object. This object will contain one key, `"lines"`, which holds an array of line objects. **Do not wrap this in a parent `{"lyrics": ...}` object**, as we are only processing a partial section.

Each **line object** in the array represents a single line of the song and must contain the following keys:
*   `line`: (string) The full text of the lyric line.
*   `startTime`: (string) The timestamp when the first word of the line is spoken/sung in `MM:SS.mmm` format.
*   `endTime`: (string) The timestamp when the last word of the line finishes in `MM:SS.mmm` format.
*   `words`: (array) An array of word objects.

Each **word object** must contain:
*   `word`: (string) The individual word. Punctuation should be attached (e.g., "cards", "fly!").
*   `startTime`: (string) The exact timestamp when the word begins in `MM:SS.mmm` format.
*   `endTime`: (string) The exact timestamp when the word ends in `MM:SS.mmm` format.

### **Step-by-Step Implementation Workflow**

This is how your local project should handle the process:

1.  **Initialize an empty list/array in your code.** Let's call it `full_lyrics_data`. This will store the results from each API call.
2.  **Parse your `DoMath_v2.txt` file section by section.** Identify the lines belonging to `[Verse 1]`, `[Chorus]`, `[Verse 2]`, etc.
3.  **Loop through each section:**
    *   **For `[Verse 1]`:** Send the audio file and only the lyrics for Verse 1 to Gemini using the prompt above.
    *   **Receive the JSON response.** It will be an object like `{ "lines": [...] }`.
    *   **Append the contents** of the `lines` array from the response to your `full_lyrics_data` list.
    *   **For `[Chorus]`:** Send the audio file and only the lyrics for the first Chorus.
    *   Receive the JSON and append its `lines` to your `full_lyrics_data` list.
    *   **Continue this process for all 7 sections** (`Verse 1`, `Chorus`, `Verse 2`, `Chorus`, `Bridge`, `Chorus`, `Outro`).
4.  **Final Assembly:** After the loop is complete, your `full_lyrics_data` list contains all the line objects for the entire song in the correct order. You can now wrap this completed list into the final JSON structure: `{ "lyrics": full_lyrics_data }`.

### **Example: First Request for [Verse 1]**

**Input Lyrics Sent in First API Call:**
```
When the night feels endless and I’m wide awake
I shuffle numbers like cards
I hum a rhythm, let the numbers dance
And suddenly it’s not so hard
```

**Expected JSON Response from First API Call:**
```json

  "lines": [
    {
      "line": "When the night feels endless and I’m wide awake",

}
```

This chunking strategy is far more resilient and is standard practice for handling API limits. It guarantees you will get all 28 lines of data without truncation.
