Yes — you can use **DALL·E 3** in Python to create a series of images with continuity, but the key is **how you structure your prompts and optionally use reference images**. Since DALL·E isn’t inherently "storyboard-aware," you have to "anchor" each generation by repeating the same descriptive elements and optionally feeding back an earlier image as a reference.

Here’s a breakdown:

---

### 🔑 Strategies for Continuity

1. **Consistent Descriptions**

   * Use the same characters, objects, colors, and style keywords in each prompt.
   * Example: *“A young woman with curly red hair, wearing a green coat and carrying a leather satchel, in watercolor style.”*
   * Always repeat those descriptors.

2. **Sequential Changes**

   * Add small changes per prompt: *“now she is entering a library,” “now she sits by the fireplace.”*
   * Keep the rest of the prompt unchanged.

3. **Image Reference (recommended for true continuity)**

   * Pass the previous image as `referenced_image_ids` so DALL·E can use it as a visual guide.
   * This is how you maintain character consistency.

### 🐍 Python Example (OpenAI client)

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import base64

client = OpenAI()

# Step 1: Generate the first image
response1 = client.images.generate(
    model="gpt-image-1",
    prompt="A young woman with curly red hair, wearing a green coat and carrying a leather satchel, watercolor illustration, walking down a cobblestone street",
    size="1024x1024"
)

image1 = response1.data[0].b64_json
with open("scene1.png", "wb") as f:
    f.write(base64.b64decode(image1))

# Step 2: Generate the next image with reference
response2 = client.images.generate(
    model="gpt-image-1",
    prompt="The same young woman with curly red hair, green coat, and satchel, now entering a library, watercolor illustration, same style",
    size="1024x1024",
    referenced_image_ids=[response1.data[0].id]  # continuity anchor
)

image2 = response2.data[0].b64_json
with open("scene2.png", "wb") as f:
    f.write(base64.b64decode(image2))
```

### ✍️ Prompt Template for Continuity

You can structure prompts like this:

```
Main subject: [consistent description of character(s)/object(s)]  
Style: [art style, e.g. watercolor, oil painting, Pixar 3D, etc.]  
Scene: [what is happening in THIS frame, keep it simple]  
Continuity: same character(s), same style, same mood
```

Example series:

1. *“A young woman with curly red hair, wearing a green coat and carrying a leather satchel, watercolor illustration, walking down a cobblestone street.”*
2. *“The same young woman, with curly red hair, green coat, and satchel, watercolor illustration, entering a grand old library.”*
3. *“The same young woman, watercolor illustration, sitting by a fireplace inside the library, reading a book.”*
