‚óè Looking at the log, the Strict Contract v1.0 implementation worked perfectly! Here's what happened:

  Success Summary:

  1. Correct Format Detected:
    - Line 127: "Detected Strict Lyric Timing Contract v1.0 format"
    - GPT-5 returned exactly the format specified in the contract
  2. Perfect Line Count:
    - Line 128: "Parsing 28 timing entries from GPT-5 response"
    - Line 131: "LLM sync completed in 101.7 seconds, got 28 timed lyrics"
    - Line 133: "Applied LLM sync to 28 scenes (matched 28/28 lyrics)"
  3. No Fragmentation:
    - Line 130: "Using Strict Contract v1.0 - no fragmentation merge needed"
    - GPT-5 returned exactly 28 lyrics for 28 input lines (not 33 fragments like before)
  4. Clean JSON Response:
    - GPT-5 returned a clean JSON object with no code fences
    - The response had the correct structure: {"version":"1.0","units":"ms","line_count":28,"lyrics":[...]}
  5. Proper Timing:
    - All times are in milliseconds as integers
    - Times align with MIDI sections (e.g., first verse starts at 6000ms, first chorus at 24000ms)
    - All 28 scenes got proper timing applied

  Key Improvements from the Strict Contract:

  - No fragmentation - GPT-5 didn't split "When the night feels endless and I'm wide awake" into two parts
  - Consistent format - All times are start_ms/end_ms in milliseconds
  - Complete coverage - All 28 lyrics were returned (unlike Gemini which only returned 24)
  - Clean output - No code fences or extra commentary

  The Strict Lyric Timing Contract v1.0 completely solved the GPT-5 issues! üéâ
