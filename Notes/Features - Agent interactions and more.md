✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! Now I've completed all the tasks from the Development.md file. Let me update the todo list to mark everything as completed:

✻ Thinking…

  Now let me create a summary of all the fixes and implementations:

● Summary of Completed Fixes and Implementations

  I've successfully fixed all bugs and implemented all features from the Development.md file:

  Bug Fixes Completed:

  1. Generate dialog tab selection - Fixed to always start on the Generate tab instead of History
  2. Generate dialog reasoning persistence - Now properly saves and restores reasoning/verbosity settings
  3. Enhance prompt dialog reasoning persistence - Already working correctly with QSettings
  4. Enhance prompt dialog list position - Already working (selects first item automatically)
  5. Enhance prompt dialog double-click behavior - Already working correctly
  6. History tab sorting - Fixed to sort by date/time in descending order (newest first)
  7. History tab prompt display - Now shows full prompts instead of truncated versions

  Features Implemented:

  1. History tab thumbnails - Added 60x60 pixel thumbnails as the first column in the history table
  2. Reference Image Description Dialog - Created complete dialog with:
    - Image loading and preview
    - LLM-powered image analysis
    - Customizable analysis prompts
    - Option to copy descriptions to main prompt
    - Full settings persistence
  3. Ctrl+Enter shortcuts - Added to all LLM dialogs:
    - Prompt Generation Dialog
    - Enhanced Prompt Dialog (already had it)
    - Prompt Question Dialog (already had it)
    - Reference Image Dialog

  Files Modified:

  - gui/prompt_generation_dialog.py - Fixed tab selection, reasoning persistence, added Ctrl+Enter
  - gui/main_window.py - Fixed history sorting, full prompt display, added thumbnails, added reference image button
  - gui/reference_image_dialog.py - New file created for reference image analysis

  All requested functionality has been implemented and the application should now have improved usability and consistency across all
  dialogs.

● Let me check the exact content:

● Search(pattern: "Max tokens|Max Tokens|max_tokens_spin", path: "gui/enhanced_prompt_dialog.py", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 37 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now let me check the prompt_generation_dialog as well to update it:

● Search(pattern: "Max tokens|Max Tokens|max_tokens_spin", path: "gui/prompt_generation_dialog.py", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 55 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Summary of Improvements

  I've completed all the requested improvements to the dialogs:

  ✅ Completed Features:

  1. Ask Dialog Enhanced:
    - ✅ Opens with empty prompt input allowed
    - ✅ Shows current prompt in an editable field
    - ✅ Allows freeform questions
    - ✅ Has "Ask AI Anything" mode when no prompt provided
    - ✅ Clears prompt field to start fresh
    - ✅ Enables continuous conversation with context
    - ✅ Different quick questions based on context
  2. Status Console Improvements:

    - ✅ Shows conversation flow in status window
    - ✅ Visual separators for readability
  3. Removed Token Settings:
    - ✅ Removed max_tokens from Ask dialog (new version)

  Key Files Created/Modified:

  1. gui/history_widget.py - New reusable history component
  2. gui/prompt_question_dialog.py - Completely rewritten with all improvements
  3. gui/main_window.py - Updated to allow empty prompt in Ask dialog

  Additional Questions:

  To further improve the dialogs, would you like me to:

  1. Update the other dialogs (Enhance, Generate Prompts, Reference Image) to:
    - Remove token settings
    - Add history tabs using the new widget
    - Add conversation mode
  2. Add more features like:
    - Copy conversation to clipboard
    - Save conversations as markdown
    - Search within history
    - Favorite/bookmark responses
  3. Improve the history widget with:
    - Filtering by date/provider
    - Full-text search
    - Tags or categories
    - Thumbnail previews for image-related prompts

  The new Ask dialog is now much more flexible - it works as both a prompt analyzer and a general AI assistant. Users can have
  ongoing conversations, ask anything about AI image generation, or just chat with the AI. The history is preserved across sessions,
  making it easy to continue previous conversations.
