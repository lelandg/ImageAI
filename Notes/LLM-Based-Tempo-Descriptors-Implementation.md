# LLM-Based Tempo Descriptor Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Compatibility:** Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5, GPT-4.1, GPT-5, all latest LLMs

---

## Overview

Replaced hardcoded BPM range mappings with LLM-based dynamic descriptor generation for video prompts. The LLM now intelligently selects and integrates tempo-appropriate descriptors (movement, camera work, energy) based on BPM values and scene context.

## Key Changes

### 1. Enhanced System Prompts (video_prompt_generator.py)

Added comprehensive tempo descriptor mapping tables to all three system prompts:
- `SYSTEM_PROMPT_WITH_CAMERA` (lines 30-80)
- `SYSTEM_PROMPT_NO_CAMERA` (lines 83-129)
- `SYSTEM_PROMPT_WITH_FLOW` (lines 132-184)

**New Tempo Descriptor Mapping:**

```markdown
## BPM-to-Visual Descriptor Mapping

**Slow (40-70 BPM):**
- Tempo feel: "slow," "contemplative," "languid," "meditative," "gentle"
- Movement: "smooth," "flowing," "graceful," "deliberate," "tender"
- Camera: "slow push-in," "static with subtle drift," "gentle pull-back"
- Energy: "calm," "serene," "melancholic," "intimate," "vulnerable"

**Moderate (70-100 BPM):**
- Tempo feel: "moderate," "steady," "measured," "walking pace," "balanced"
- Movement: "natural," "measured," "rhythmic," "swaying," "grounded"
- Camera: "dolly-in," "gentle pan," "tracking shot," "slow orbit"
- Energy: "contemplative," "reflective," "grounded," "thoughtful"

**Upbeat (100-130 BPM):**
- Tempo feel: "upbeat," "energetic," "lively," "driving," "spirited"
- Movement: "bouncing," "rhythmic," "dynamic," "pulsing," "vibrant"
- Camera: "smooth gimbal tracking," "dynamic push-in," "orbiting"
- Energy: "energetic," "vibrant," "enthusiastic," "joyful," "spirited"

**Fast (130-160 BPM):**
- Tempo feel: "fast," "intense," "rapid," "vigorous," "driving"
- Movement: "sharp," "quick," "staccato," "explosive," "powerful"
- Camera: "fast zoom," "aggressive tracking," "rapid pan," "dynamic orbit"
- Energy: "intense," "high-energy," "electric," "powerful," "commanding"

**Very Fast (160+ BPM):**
- Tempo feel: "very fast," "frenetic," "breakneck," "blazing," "relentless"
- Movement: "rapid-fire," "explosive," "frantic," "intense," "overwhelming"
- Camera: "aggressive movement," "fast whip pan," "extreme zoom"
- Energy: "frenetic," "explosive," "chaotic," "overwhelming," "visceral"
```

### 2. Simplified Tempo Guidance Code

**Old Code (Hardcoded):**
```python
# Lines 164-173 (OLD)
tempo_guidance = ""
if context.tempo_bpm:
    if context.tempo_bpm >= 140:
        tempo_guidance = f"\nTempo: {context.tempo_bpm:.0f} BPM (Fast/Energetic - use quick camera movements, dynamic action, energetic pacing)"
    elif context.tempo_bpm >= 100:
        tempo_guidance = f"\nTempo: {context.tempo_bpm:.0f} BPM (Medium - balanced pacing and energy)"
    elif context.tempo_bpm >= 80:
        tempo_guidance = f"\nTempo: {context.tempo_bpm:.0f} BPM (Moderate - smooth movements, contemplative pacing)"
    else:
        tempo_guidance = f"\nTempo: {context.tempo_bpm:.0f} BPM (Slow/Ballad - gentle movements, emotional depth)"
```

**New Code (LLM-Based):**
```python
# Lines 266-269 (NEW)
tempo_guidance = ""
if context.tempo_bpm:
    tempo_guidance = f"\nTempo: {context.tempo_bpm:.0f} BPM (use descriptor mapping to integrate tempo-appropriate movement, camera work, and energy)"
```

**Similar changes made in batch generation** (lines 439-442).

## Benefits

### ✅ Dynamic Descriptor Selection
- LLM can **blend descriptors** for edge cases (e.g., 110 BPM = mix of moderate + upbeat)
- **Context-aware**: Considers scene emotion, genre, and narrative alongside tempo
- **Natural integration**: Descriptors woven naturally into prompts, not rigid substitution

### ✅ No More Hardcoded Ranges
- **Before**: Python if/elif chains with fixed BPM thresholds
- **After**: LLM learns from descriptor mapping table and applies contextually
- **More flexible**: Handles edge cases and nuanced tempo variations

### ✅ Enhanced Creativity
- **Cinematic quality**: More sophisticated and varied language
- **Provider-specific strengths**:
  - Claude Sonnet 4.5: Most elegant, creative prose
  - Gemini 2.5: Fast, efficient, multimodal understanding
  - GPT-4.1/GPT-5: Versatile, balanced output

### ✅ Maintains UI Visibility
- **BPM value still displayed** in UI for user reference
- **LLM uses it behind the scenes** for descriptor selection
- **Transparent process**: Users understand what tempo was detected

## Technical Implementation

### Code Flow

1. **User provides BPM** (detected from audio or manually entered)
2. **VideoPromptContext created** with `tempo_bpm` field set
3. **System prompt loaded** with tempo descriptor mapping table
4. **User prompt generated** with BPM value and instruction to use descriptor mapping
5. **LLM processes request**:
   - Identifies BPM category (Slow/Moderate/Upbeat/Fast/Very Fast)
   - Selects appropriate descriptors from mapping table
   - Integrates naturally into video prompt
6. **Video prompt returned** with tempo-appropriate language

### LiteLLM Integration

```python
# video_prompt_generator.py:243-251
response = litellm.completion(
    model=model_id,  # e.g., "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5"
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},  # Includes descriptor mapping
        {"role": "user", "content": user_prompt}       # Includes BPM + scene
    ],
    temperature=temperature,
    max_tokens=200
)
```

LiteLLM automatically handles:
- **Provider-specific prefixes** (`anthropic/`, `gemini/`, etc.)
- **Model parameter compatibility** (temperature constraints, token limits)
- **API key management** (via config)

---

## Testing

### Test Script: `test_tempo_descriptors.py`

Run the test script to verify the implementation:

```bash
python3 test_tempo_descriptors.py
```

**Output demonstrates:**
- System prompt structure with descriptor mapping
- 5 test cases spanning all BPM ranges (60, 90, 120, 140, 170 BPM)
- Expected LLM behavior for each category
- Example generated prompts
- Model compatibility verification
- Key improvements summary

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Projects

**No migration required!** The changes are backward compatible:

1. **BPM detection still works** - No changes to audio analysis code
2. **UI still displays BPM** - Users see the detected tempo value
3. **Video prompts automatically enhanced** - LLM now handles descriptor selection
4. **Currently selected LLM used** - Uses whatever model is configured in UI

### For Developers

If you've been using hardcoded BPM ranges elsewhere in the codebase:

**Before (Don't do this anymore):**
```python
if bpm >= 140:
    description = "Fast/Energetic"
elif bpm >= 100:
    description = "Medium"
# ...
```

**After (Use LLM-based approach):**
```python
# Let the LLM select descriptors via system prompt
tempo_guidance = f"Tempo: {bpm:.0f} BPM (use descriptor mapping)"
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Genre-Specific Descriptors**
   - Add genre context to descriptor selection (Hip-hop, EDM, Rock, Classical)
   - Different movement vocabularies per genre

2. **Mood-Tempo Interaction**
   - Handle conflicting signals (sad lyric + fast BPM)
   - Nuanced descriptor blending based on emotional context

3. **Caching Common BPM Ranges**
   - Cache LLM responses for frequently used BPMs (90, 100, 120, 140)
   - Reduce API costs for batch processing

4. **Provider-Specific Optimization**
   - Tailor system prompts per provider (Claude vs Gemini vs GPT)
   - Leverage each model's unique strengths

5. **User Feedback Loop**
   - Track which LLM-generated prompts users keep vs regenerate
   - Refine descriptor mapping based on user preferences
