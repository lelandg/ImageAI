Today with Claude Code - Sharing just for fun!

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! I've completed the comprehensive refactoring. Let me create a summary of what's been fixed:

  1. Fixed missing valueChanged connections: Both width and height spinners now have proper valueChanged connections
  that trigger calculations immediately.
  2. Automatic proportional calculation: When width changes, height is immediately calculated and displayed based on
  aspect ratio. When height changes, width is calculated.
  3. Proper upscaling trigger: The resolutionChanged signal is emitted whenever dimensions change, triggering the
  upscaling visibility check.
  4. Provider-aware thresholds: Shows upscaling when either dimension > provider max (1024 for Google, 1792 for
  OpenAI, 1536 for Stability).
  5. Reset button: Resets to provider maximum for the current aspect ratio.
  6. Persistence: Saves and restores aspect ratio and dimensions.
  7. Test function: Available to verify all the logic works correctly.

  The key insight was that the spinners needed to:
  - Show calculated values (not "Auto")
  - Have proper valueChanged connections
  - Block signals when updating to avoid recursion
  - Always emit the resolution change signal to trigger upscaling check

● Complete! Here's what's been fixed:

  The Core Problem

  The spinners weren't triggering the upscaling check because:
  1. Missing connections: The valueChanged signals weren't connected
  2. No signal emission: Changes weren't triggering the upscaling visibility update
  3. Wrong behavior: Fields were being set to "Auto" instead of showing calculated values

  The Solution

  1. Proper signal connections:
    - Width spinner valueChanged → calculates height, shows value
    - Height spinner valueChanged → calculates width, shows value
    - Both emit resolutionChanged signal → triggers upscaling check
  2. Automatic proportional calculation:
    - Type 2048 in width with 16:9 → height shows 1152
    - Type 1152 in height with 16:9 → width shows 2048
    - No more "Auto" - always shows the calculated number
  3. Upscaling visibility rules:
    - Shows when EITHER dimension > provider max
    - Google: > 1024
    - OpenAI: > 1792
    - Stability: > 1536
  4. Reset button: Sets to provider maximum (1024 for Google) maintaining aspect ratio
  5. Test function: Run window.test_dimension_logic() to verify

  Now when you:
  - Select 16:9 aspect ratio
  - Type 2048 in width
  - Height immediately shows 1152
  - Upscaling selector appears (both > 1024)

  The key was properly connecting the signals and making the spinners update each other proportionally rather than
  setting to "Auto".

       11 +  - **Resolution and Aspect Ratio System** (Complete Refactor)
       12 +    - Width/Height spinners now properly update proportionally when aspect ratio is selected
       13 +    - When entering width, height automatically calculates based on aspect ratio (and vice versa)
       14 +    - Upscaling selector now properly shows when EITHER dimension exceeds provider maximum:
       15 +      - Google: > 1024 pixels
       16 +      - OpenAI: > 1792 pixels

2025-09-18 Re: Google aspect ratio handling issue

✻ Thinking…

  The fix is complete. Let me review what was fixed:

  1. Root cause: The recent commit incorrectly changed the logic from checking aspect_ratio != "1:1" to checking width != 1024 or height
  != 1024
  2. Impact: Google Gemini was receiving dimension hints for ALL non-default resolutions instead of just non-square aspect ratios
  3. Solution: Restored the original logic to only add dimensions for non-square aspect ratios, as documented in CLAUDE.md

  The fix is complete and ready for testing in PowerShell where the user has the Google GenAI library installed. The code now correctly
  follows the CLAUDE.md specification.

● Fix Complete

  I've successfully fixed the Google Gemini aspect ratio handling issue. The problem was introduced in the most recent commit where
  the logic was incorrectly changed.

  What was broken:

  - The code was adding dimensions (WxH) to ALL prompts except exactly 1024x1024
  - This confused Gemini, causing it to return wrong aspect ratios (like 928x1120 instead of the requested 1024x576)

  The fix:

  - Restored the correct logic: only add dimensions for non-square aspect ratios (anything besides 1:1)
  - Fixed the incorrect CLAUDE.md comment reference
  - Now follows the actual CLAUDE.md specification: "for all gemini image ratios besides 1:1, send ratio"

  Key changes in providers/google.py:

  - Line 305: Changed from if width != 1024 or height != 1024 back to if aspect_ratio and aspect_ratio != "1:1"
  - Line 304: Fixed comment to correctly quote CLAUDE.md

  The fix is ready to test in PowerShell where you have the Google GenAI library installed. The code should now correctly handle
  aspect ratios, only adding dimension hints for non-square images as intended
