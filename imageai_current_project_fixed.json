The subject paces slowly, hands clasped behind back, bathed in cool blue moonlight streaming through the glass. Soft rim lighting separates them from the urban backdrop. Shallow depth of field keeps cityscape beautifully blurred into bokeh orbs. Shot on 35mm film with subtle grain, creating a contemplative, melancholic atmosphere. Composition follows rule of thirds, figure positioned left, vast empty space suggesting isolation and restlessness.",
