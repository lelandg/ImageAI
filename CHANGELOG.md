# Changelog

All notable changes to ImageAI will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.10.3] - 2025-01-12

### Added
- **Custom Aspect Ratio Input** - New manual input field for entering custom aspect ratios
  - Supports ratio format (e.g., "16:10") and decimal format (e.g., "1.6")
  - Input validation ensures only valid formats are accepted
  - Custom button with visual indicator when active
- **Resolution/Aspect Ratio Mode Indicator** - Clear visual feedback showing which control is active
  - Green badge with "Using Aspect Ratio" when AR controls dimensions
  - Blue badge with "Using Resolution" when manual resolution is selected
  - Info text shows current mode and calculated values

### Changed
- **Enhanced Aspect Ratio Selector** - Improved interaction between aspect ratio and resolution controls
  - Selecting an aspect ratio automatically switches resolution to "Auto (from AR)" mode
  - Selecting a manual resolution automatically deselects all aspect ratio buttons
  - Resolution selector shows calculated resolution when in auto mode
- **Smart Resolution Calculation** - Provider-aware resolution calculation from aspect ratios
  - DALL¬∑E 3: Maps to supported sizes (1024√ó1024, 1792√ó1024, 1024√ó1792)
  - Google Gemini: Maintains square (1:1) limitation
  - Stability AI: Maps to optimal SDXL resolutions

### Fixed
- Generation parameters now correctly send either aspect ratio OR resolution, not both
- Resolution selector properly updates when aspect ratio changes
- Clear visual feedback prevents confusion about which setting is controlling dimensions

## [0.10.1] - 2025-01-11

### Changed
- Cleaned up development notices from documentation
- Updated video feature status from "Coming Soon" to "Planned" for Veo integration
- Enhanced README documentation with comprehensive video feature details
- Added comprehensive pricing comparison table with free tier details

### Fixed
- Version number properly incremented to reflect stable UI implementation
- Google Gemini aspect ratio handling - now correctly indicates only square (1:1) images are supported
- Disabled aspect ratio selector for Google provider with explanatory tooltip
- Updated provider code to add aspect ratio hints to prompts for Google (best effort)

### Removed
- Removed Imagen 3/4 models from UI - these require Vertex AI access, not available through Gemini API
- Note: Imagen models (imagen-3.0-generate-002, imagen-4.0-generate-001) require Google Cloud Vertex AI, not the standard Gemini API used by ImageAI

### Known Limitations
- Google Gemini (Nano Banana) only generates square images regardless of aspect ratio settings

## [0.10.0] - 2025-01-11

### Added
